# SOLID-principles
This repo explores the SOLID principles for designing maintainable, understandable, and flexible object-oriented software. Through real-world examples, we'll analyze existing solutions, identify their shortcomings, and propose more SOLID designs.

# SOLID Principles Workshop

This repository contains solutions and refactored code for the SOLID Principles workshop. 
The SOLID principles are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming aimed at enhancing code maintainability and extensibility.

## Structure

The repository is structured into subdirectories corresponding to each SOLID principle:

- SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- OCP (Open-Closed Principle)
- LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)
- ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)
- DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)

Each directory contains:
- An example showcasing the principle
- A refactored solution demonstrating a more SOLID design
- An exercise for you to apply the principle

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SOLID.git

2. Navigate to the desired principle's directory:
  ```bash
  cd SRP  # Replace with the principle you want to explore
  ```
3. Read the example code, refactored solution, and exercise. (With their suitable plantUML code and UML diagram class representation)

4. Analyze and apply the SOLID principle to the exercise.
